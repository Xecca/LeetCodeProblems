//Given two integer arrays arr1 and arr2, and the integer d, return the distance value between the two arrays.
//
//The distance value is defined as the number of elements arr1[i] such that there is not any element arr2[j] where |arr1[i]-arr2[j]| <= d.

//Input:
let arr1 = [4,5,8], arr2 = [10,9,1,8], d = 2
//Output: 2
//Explanation:
//For arr1[0]=4 we have:
//|4-10|=6 > d=2
//|4-9|=5 > d=2
//|4-1|=3 > d=2
//|4-8|=4 > d=2
//For arr1[1]=5 we have:
//|5-10|=5 > d=2
//|5-9|=4 > d=2
//|5-1|=4 > d=2
//|5-8|=3 > d=2
//For arr1[2]=8 we have:
//|8-10|=2 <= d=2
//|8-9|=1 <= d=2
//|8-1|=7 > d=2
//|8-8|=0 <= d=2

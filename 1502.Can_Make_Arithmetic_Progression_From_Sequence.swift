//Given an array of numbers arr. A sequence of numbers is called an arithmetic progression if the difference between any two consecutive elements is the same.
//
//Return true if the array can be rearranged to form an arithmetic progression, otherwise, return false.

func canMakeArithmeticProgression(_ arr: [Int]) -> Bool {
    var i = 0
    let length = arr.count
    let sortArr = arr.sorted()
    let denominatorOfProgression = sortArr[i] - sortArr[i + 1]
    
    while i < length {
        if i + 1 < length {
            if sortArr[i] - sortArr[i + 1] != denominatorOfProgression {
                return false
            }
        }
        i += 1
    }
    
    return true
}

//Input:
let arr = [3,5,1]
//Output: true
//Explanation: We can reorder the elements as [1,3,5] or [5,3,1] with differences 2 and -2 respectively, between each consecutive elements.

//Runtime: 4 ms, faster than 100.00% of Swift online submissions for Minimum Cost to Move Chips to The Same Position.
//Memory Usage: 13.9 MB, less than 100.00% of Swift online submissions for Minimum Cost to Move Chips to The Same Position.
//----------------------------------------------------

//We have n chips, where the position of the ith chip is position[i].
//
//We need to move all the chips to the same position. In one step, we can change the position of the ith chip from position[i] to:
//
//position[i] + 2 or position[i] - 2 with cost = 0.
//position[i] + 1 or position[i] - 1 with cost = 1.
//Return the minimum cost needed to move all the chips to the same position.
//
//Constraints:
//
//1 <= position.length <= 100
//1 <= position[i] <= 10^9

//----------------------------------------------------

func minCostToMoveChips(_ position: [Int]) -> Int {
    var even = 0
    var odd = 0
    
    for num in position {
        if num % 2 == 0 {
            even += 1
        } else {
            odd += 1
        }
    }
    
    if odd > even {
        return even
    }
    
    return odd
}

//Example 1:
//Input: position = [1,2,3]
//Output: 1
//Explanation: First step: Move the chip at position 3 to position 1 with cost = 0.
//Second step: Move the chip at position 2 to position 1 with cost = 1.
//Total cost is 1.
//
//Example 2:
//Input: position = [2,2,2,3,3]
//Output: 2
//Explanation: We can move the two chips at position  3 to position 2. Each move has cost = 1. The total cost = 2.
//
//Example 3:
//Input: position = [1,1000000000]
//Output: 1

//Test cases:
//
if minCostToMoveChips([1,2,3]) == 1 { print("Correct!") } else { print("Error! Expected: \(1)") }
if minCostToMoveChips([2,2,2,3,3]) == 2 { print("Correct!") } else { print("Error! Expected: \(2)") }
if minCostToMoveChips([1,1000000000]) == 1 { print("Correct!") } else { print("Error! Expected: \(1)") }

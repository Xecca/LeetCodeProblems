//Every non-negative integer N has a binary representation.  For example, 5 can be represented as "101" in binary, 11 as "1011" in binary, and so on.  Note that except for N = 0, there are no leading zeroes in any binary representation.
//
//The complement of a binary representation is the number in binary you get when changing every 1 to a 0 and 0 to a 1.  For example, the complement of "101" in binary is "010" in binary.
//
//For a given number N in base-10, return the complement of it's binary representation as a base-10 integer.

        }
        multi *= 2
        i -= 1
    }

    return sum
}

//Input:
let N = 5
//Output: 2
//Explanation: 5 is "101" in binary, with complement "010" in binary, which is 2 in base-10.

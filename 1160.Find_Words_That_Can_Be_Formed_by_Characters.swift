//----------------------------------------------------
//You are given an array of strings words and a string chars.
//
//A string is good if it can be formed by characters from chars (each character can only be used once).
//
//Return the sum of lengths of all good strings in words.

//    print(charsCount)

}

//Input:
let words = ["hello","world","leetcode"], chars = "welldonehoneyr"
//Output: 6
//Explanation:
//The strings that can be formed are "cat" and "hat" so the answer is 3 + 3 = 6.

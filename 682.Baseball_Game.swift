//You're now a baseball game point recorder.
//
//Given a list of strings, each string can be one of the 4 following types:
//
//Integer (one round's score): Directly represents the number of points you get in this round.
//"+" (one round's score): Represents that the points you get in this round are the sum of the last two valid round's points.
//"D" (one round's score): Represents that the points you get in this round are the doubled data of the last valid round's points.
//"C" (an operation, which isn't a round's score): Represents the last valid round's points you get were invalid and should be removed.
//Each round's operation is permanent and could have an impact on the round before and the round after.
//
//You need to return the sum of the points you could get in all the rounds.

//Input:
let ops = ["5","2","C","D","+"]
//Output: 30
//Explanation:
//Round 1: You could get 5 points. The sum is: 5.
//Round 2: You could get 2 points. The sum is: 7.
//Operation 1: The round 2's data was invalid. The sum is: 5.
//Round 3: You could get 10 points (the round 2's data has been removed). The sum is: 15.
//Round 4: You could get 5 + 10 = 15 points. The sum is: 30.

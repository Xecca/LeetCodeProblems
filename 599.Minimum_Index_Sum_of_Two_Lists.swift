//Suppose Andy and Doris want to choose a restaurant for dinner, and they both have a list of favorite restaurants represented by strings.
//
//You need to help them find out their common interest with the least list index sum. If there is a choice tie between answers, output all of them with no order requirement. You could assume there always exists an answer.

//Input:
//let list1 = ["Shogun","Tapioca Express","Burger King","KFC"], list2 = ["Piatti","The Grill at Torrey Pines","Hungry Hunter Steakhouse","Shogun"]
//Output: ["Shogun"]
//Explanation: The only restaurant they both like is "Shogun".
//Example 2:
//Input:
//let list1 = ["Shogun","Tapioca Express","Burger King","KFC"], list2 = ["KFC","Shogun","Burger King"]
//Output: ["Shogun"]
//Explanation: The restaurant they both like and have the least index sum is "Shogun" with index sum 1 (0+1).
//Example 4:
//Input:
let list1 = ["Shogun","Tapioca Express","Burger King","KFC"], list2 = ["KNN","KFC","Burger King","Tapioca Express","Shogun"]
//Output: ["KFC","Burger King","Tapioca Express","Shogun"]

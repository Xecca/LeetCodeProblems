//We are given two sentences A and B.  (A sentence is a string of space separated words.  Each word consists only of lowercase letters.)
//
//A word is uncommon if it appears exactly once in one of the sentences, and does not appear in the other sentence.
//
//Return a list of all uncommon words.
//
//You may return the list in any order.

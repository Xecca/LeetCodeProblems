//Given scores of N athletes, find their relative ranks and the people with the top three highest scores, who will be awarded medals: "Gold Medal", "Silver Medal" and "Bronze Medal".

//Note:
//N is a positive integer and won't exceed 10,000.
//All the scores of athletes are guaranteed to be unique.

    let newRank = nums.sorted(by: >)
    var relativeRank = [String]()
    var dictWithRank = [Int : String]()
    
    for (i, num) in newRank.enumerated() {
        if i == 0 {

            dictWithRank.updateValue("Bronze Medal", forKey: num)

    for rank in nums {
        relativeRank.append(dictWithRank[rank] ?? "0")
    }
    
    return relativeRank
}

//Input:
let nums = [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
//Output: ["Gold Medal", "Silver Medal", "Bronze Medal", "4", "5"]
//Explanation: The first three athletes got the top three highest scores, so they got "Gold Medal", "Silver Medal" and "Bronze Medal".
//For the left two athletes, you just need to output their relative ranks according to their scores.

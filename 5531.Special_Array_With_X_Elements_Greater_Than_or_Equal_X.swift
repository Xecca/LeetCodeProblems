//You are given an array nums of non-negative integers. nums is considered special if there exists a number x such that there are exactly x numbers in nums that are greater than or equal to x.
//
//Notice that x does not have to be an element in nums.
//
//Return x if the array is special, otherwise, return -1. It can be proven that if nums is special, the value for x is unique.
//Constraints:
//
//1 <= nums.length <= 100
//0 <= nums[i] <= 1000

//----------------------------------------------------

func specialArray(_ nums: [Int]) -> Int {
    var greaterOrEqualsXCount = 0
    var x = 0
    var countNums = nums.count
    let maxValueInArr = nums.max()
    
    if maxValueInArr! > countNums {
        countNums = maxValueInArr!
    }
    
    while x < countNums {
        greaterOrEqualsXCount = 0
        for num in nums {
            if num >= x {
                greaterOrEqualsXCount += 1
            }
        }
        if greaterOrEqualsXCount == x {
            return x
        }
        x += 1
    }
    if greaterOrEqualsXCount == x {
        return x
    }
    
    return -1
}

//Input:
let nums = [3, 5]
//Output: 2
//Explanation: There are 2 values (3 and 5) that are greater than or equal to 2.
//Example 2:
//
//Input: nums = [0,0]
//Output: -1
//Explanation: No numbers fit the criteria for x.
//If x = 0, there should be 0 numbers >= x, but there are 2.
//If x = 1, there should be 1 number >= x, but there are 0.
//If x = 2, there should be 2 numbers >= x, but there are 0.
//x cannot be greater since there are only 2 numbers in nums.

//Tic-tac-toe is played by two players A and B on a 3 x 3 grid.
//
//Here are the rules of Tic-Tac-Toe:
//
//Players take turns placing characters into empty squares (" ").
//The first player A always places "X" characters, while the second player B always places "O" characters.
//"X" and "O" characters are always placed into empty squares, never on filled ones.
//The game ends when there are 3 of the same (non-empty) character filling any row, column, or diagonal.
//The game also ends if all squares are non-empty.
//No more moves can be played if the game is over.
//Given an array moves where each element is another array of size 2 corresponding to the row and column of the grid where they mark their respective character in the order in which A and B play.
//
//Return the winner of the game if it exists (A or B), in case the game ends in a draw return "Draw", if there are still movements to play return "Pending".
//
//You can assume that moves is valid (It follows the rules of Tic-Tac-Toe), the grid is initially empty and A will play first.

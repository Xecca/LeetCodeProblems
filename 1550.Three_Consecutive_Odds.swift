//Given an integer array arr, return true if there are three consecutive odd numbers in the array. Otherwise, return false.
//
//Constraints:
//
//1 <= arr.length <= 1000
//1 <= arr[i] <= 1000

    var countCons = 0

}

//Example 1:
//Input: arr = [2,6,4,1]
//Output: false
//Explanation: There are no three consecutive odds.
//Example 2:
//Input: arr = [1,2,34,3,4,5,7,23,12]
//Output: true
//Explanation: [5,7,23] are three consecutive odds.

//Test cases:
//
if threeConsecutiveOdds([2,6,4,1]) == false { print("Correct!") } else { print("Error! Expected: \(false)") }
if threeConsecutiveOdds([1,2,34,3,4,5,7,23,12]) == true { print("Correct!") } else { print("Error! Expected: \(true)") }
